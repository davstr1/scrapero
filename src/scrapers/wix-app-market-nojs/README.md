# Wix App Market No-JS Scraper

## Status: Partially Functional - Requires JavaScript

After implementing and testing the no-JavaScript approach, we discovered that Wix App Market is a React SPA that requires JavaScript to render content. While the infrastructure works, data extraction is severely limited without JavaScript rendering.

## What Works

- ✅ HTTP client with retry logic
- ✅ URL discovery for categories
- ✅ Category mapping and structure
- ✅ Basic HTML fetching
- ✅ CLI interface

## What Doesn't Work

- ❌ App data extraction (ratings, installs, developer info)
- ❌ Subcategory discovery
- ❌ Full app listings (only initial page load)

## Key Findings

1. **Wix uses React SPA**: All content is dynamically rendered
2. **No server-side rendering**: HTML contains minimal data
3. **Data in JavaScript**: App information is embedded in JS variables or loaded via API

## Recommendation

**Use the Puppeteer-based scraper** (`wix-app-market`) instead of this no-JS version. The JavaScript rendering is essential for:
- Extracting accurate app data
- Discovering all apps (infinite scroll)
- Getting complete category listings

## If You Must Use No-JS

Limited data can be extracted:
- App names from title tags
- Basic category structure
- App URLs from initial page load

But critical data like ratings, installs, and pricing requires JavaScript execution.

## Usage (Limited Functionality)

```bash
# Discover URLs (limited to initial page content)
node index.js discover

# Scrape apps (will have missing data)
node index.js scrape

# Test single app
node index.js test
```

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Find Wix API**: Check if Wix has an official API for app data
2. **Reverse engineer API calls**: Monitor network requests in browser
3. **Use Puppeteer version**: The existing `wix-app-market` scraper with browser automation
