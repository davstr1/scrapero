## HTML Structure Patterns

### Non-Obfuscated Elements Found
1. **Section Names**:
   - "Team Picks"
   - "Trending Now"
   - "Wix Business Solutions"
   - "Social Apps"
   - "Made by Wix"

2. **Navigation Elements**:
   - Clear category navigation structure
   - Subcategory organization within main categories

3. **App Card Structure**:
   - App icon (42x42 pixels)
   - App name
   - Short description
   - Rating (X/5 stars)
   - Number of reviews
   - Pricing information
   - Badges (e.g., "Wix Choice", discount percentages)

### App Detail Page Structure
1. **App Information**:
   - Name and tagline
   - Detailed description
   - Feature list
   - Pricing tiers (Basic, Essential, Premium)
   - Screenshot carousel (4-5 images)

2. **Developer Information**:
   - Developer name
   - Website link
   - Support email
   - Privacy policy link

3. **Reviews Section**:
   - Overall rating
   - Total review count
   - Rating breakdown by stars
   - Sorting options (recent, helpful, highest)
   - Individual review display

## Data Extraction Patterns

### Category Pages
- Apps displayed in horizontal scrollable rows
- "View All X Apps" links for each subcategory
- No visible pagination (likely uses JavaScript for loading more)

### Subcategory Pages
- Grid layout of apps
- Approximately 20-25 apps visible without JS
- No clear pagination controls

### App Pages
- Comprehensive app details available
- Structured pricing information
- Review data accessible

## Scraping Approach Without JavaScript

### Reliable Patterns
1. **URL Structure**: Consistent and predictable
2. **Navigation**: Category structure is accessible
3. **Basic App Info**: Name, description, rating available
4. **Developer Info**: Contact details present

### Limitations Without JS
1. **Limited App Listings**: Only initial apps visible on category pages
2. **No Dynamic Loading**: Can't access full app inventory
3. **Missing Interactions**: Can't load more reviews or screenshots
4. **No Filtering**: Advanced search/filter options unavailable

### Recommended Approach
1. Start with category navigation to build URL list
2. Scrape subcategory pages for initial app listings
3. Follow app URLs to get detailed information
4. Store app slugs for direct access
5. Monitor for new apps through category pages

## Technical Considerations

### Challenges
- Most class names are obfuscated (React/styled-components)
- Dynamic content loading requires JS
- Full app inventory not accessible without JS
- Rate limiting may apply

### Opportunities
- URL patterns are consistent and semantic
- Basic app information is available in HTML
- Category structure is well-defined
- Some semantic class names exist ("Team Picks", etc.)

## Conclusion
While Wix App Market heavily relies on JavaScript for full functionality, basic scraping is possible using:
- Predictable URL patterns
- Initial HTML content
- Category navigation structure
- Direct app page access

For comprehensive scraping, JavaScript rendering would be beneficial but not strictly necessary for basic app information extraction.
