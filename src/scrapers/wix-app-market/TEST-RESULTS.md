# Wix App Market Scraper Test Results

## Summary
The scraper is partially functional but needs selector updates to work properly with Wix's current page structure.

## What Works ✅

### 1. Infrastructure
- Browser pool management works correctly
- Navigation to pages succeeds
- Basic data extraction framework functions
- CLI commands execute properly
- Screenshot and HTML saving for debugging

### 2. Partial Data Extraction
- App name/title (using h2 selector)
- Short descriptions
- Basic pricing detection
- App icon URLs (found in images array)
- Category discovery (finds 6 main categories)

## What Doesn't Work ❌

### 1. Category Discovery
- **Issue**: No subcategories found (0 for all categories)
- **Cause**: Page structure doesn't match expected selectors
- **Impact**: Can't build complete category hierarchy

### 2. App Data Extraction
- **Missing Fields**:
  - Ratings and review counts
  - Installation statistics
  - Developer information (clean extraction)
  - Screenshots (found but not properly filtered)
  - Tags and languages
  - Last updated date

### 3. Selector Issues
- Current selectors don't match Wix's React-based structure
- Dynamic content loading not fully handled
- Data attributes and class names are obfuscated

## Root Causes

1. **Heavy React/JavaScript**: Wix uses a complex SPA that renders content dynamically
2. **Obfuscated Classes**: Class names appear to be generated/minified
3. **Nested Components**: Data is deeply nested in React components
4. **Different Page Structures**: Category vs app pages have very different layouts

## Recommendations for Fixes

### 1. Update Selectors
- Use more generic patterns that don't rely on specific class names
- Focus on aria-labels and data attributes
- Use text content matching for reliability

### 2. Improve Wait Strategies
- Wait for specific content indicators
- Add explicit waits for dynamic content
- Use mutation observers for React rendering

### 3. Enhanced Data Extraction
- Parse structured data from page scripts
- Use regex patterns on full page text
- Extract from meta tags and JSON-LD

### 4. Category Discovery Fix
- Look for section headers differently
- Parse URL patterns for subcategories
- Use sitemap if available

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix category discovery to find subcategories
2. **Priority 2**: Update app data selectors for critical fields
3. **Priority 3**: Improve reliability with better wait strategies
4. **Priority 4**: Add fallback extraction methods

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Test single app
node index.js test

# Test category discovery
node index.js discover-categories

# Debug with visible browser
node debug-wix.js
```

## Sample Output Issues

### Current App Data (Incomplete):
```json
{
  "name": "",  // Empty - selector issue
  "rating": 0, // Not found
  "installs": "", // Not found

}
```

### Expected App Data:
```json
{
  "name": "TWIPLA Website Intelligence",
