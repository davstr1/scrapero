WP Control,https://wordpress.org/plugins/0-day-analytics/,Golemiq,"Description WP Control is a powerful plugin designed for WordPress sites with extensive error logs. It allows administrators to: – Read and analyze error logs even if the error log is gigabytes of size. (Only up to last 100 records are shown) Filtering by type is supported. The limitation is necessary for two reasons – first if there are more errors they are either not relevant or repeating ones, and second – that way your server will continue operate without any interruptions even if your log is few gigs of data. – Enable or disable error logging directly from the WordPress dashboard. – Manage large log files without performance degradation. – Cron manager at the tip of your fingers (edit / delete / run) – Transient manager – all (stored in the DB) transients (edit / delete) – Environment type – There is the notification in the admin bar which tells you what is the selected type of the current environment you are on (can change it (the env type) from the settings or completely disable it) – Plugin version switcher – Now you can change the plugin version directly from the admin Plugins page of your WordPress. Shows the path where main plugin file is located. – Easily see where exactly error is thrown (where detected) This plugin is ideal for developers and administrators who need robust tools for troubleshooting and maintenance. You can see it in action here or use the “Live Preview” button on the WordPress plugin page. Key Features: – Handles gigabyte-sized error logs seamlessly. – Option to enable or disable logging via the admin interface. – Optimized for high-performance even with large log files. – Provides insights into logged errors for efficient troubleshooting. – Build-in fully functional Cron manager. – Build-in fully functional Transients manager. – Build-in badge that shows you current environment type. – Option to randomize the name of the error log file (security). – Easily plugin version switch (the ones from official WP marketstore). – Build-in dark mode.

Late Caching for Feeds,https://wordpress.org/plugins/0-delay-late-caching-for-feeds/,miunosoft,"Description What is Late Caching? Have you ever felt that a page having RSS feeds loads relatively slow when it renews their caches? The current implementation of the WordPress built-in feed caching mechanism renews the cache during the page load when it is expired. When this happens, it takes some time to load while the server accesses the external feed source. This is noticeable for site visitors in most cases and they may leave the site unless they are patient enough. What this plugin does is to put off the refresh process and to make it done later in the background process. Immediate Caching (WordPress Default Behavior): A page loads and detects a feed is expired. Fetches new contents of the feed. Displays them. The step 2 above takes time and noticeable to the viewer. Late Caching: A page loads and detects a feed is expired. Schedules a cache renewal event in the background. Displays the expired contents. The cache gets renewed in the background and the updated contents are displayed in the next page load. 1.0.2 – 2018/11/02 Fixed a bug with multiple feed urls passed to fetch_feed(). 1.0.1 – 2018/10/30 Fixed redundant function calls. 1.0.0 – 2018/10/29 Released initially.",0,0,,,,,,0,7 years ago,4.9.26,https://s.w.org/plugins/geopattern-icon/0-delay-late-caching-for-feeds.svg,free,2025-07-05T17:08:50.539Z,1.0.2,2555,https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/0-delay-late-caching-for-feeds.1.0.2.zip,3.5 or higher,5.2.4 or higher,0,0,,,,"Description What is Late Caching?
