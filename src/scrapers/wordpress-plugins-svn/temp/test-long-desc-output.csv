Reviews 4 YEARS gogolmogol777 July 4, 2025 Thank you for the years of cooperation! Great product that keeps up with the times! Great Tool, Not great compatibility Ruan July 3, 2025 1 reply Elementor has been a reliable and fantastic tool for the past eight years, and I‚Äôve had nothing but positive experiences working with it. Building a pixel-perfect website with Elementor is an incredible experience. It‚Äôs truly unmatched, except for Bricks Builder. However, I‚Äôve encountered some issues with Elementor recently. It seems to be related to incompatible plugins or when I use the updater tool, which can create a ‚Äúdogpile effect‚Äù or a ‚Äúrace condition‚Äù due to caching and the Crocoblock plugins triggering a caching loop that has crashed my servers. I truly appreciate this amazing tool that has helped me transition from a complete beginner to a proficient web developer. While I‚Äôm not a fan of the AI features, I would rather have a fast and stable tool that works flawlessly. Thank you for creating such a fantastic create tool. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for your hard work and dedication. New top bar arturs57 July 2, 2025 2 replies The new toolbar sucks! Where‚Äôs the option to go back to the previous interface?

WooCommerce Support ‚Äì thank you! sdf01 July 2, 2025 3 replies My WC shop completely broke (images not loading, customers unable to download files) a few days ago ‚Äì and I‚Äôm blown away by the technical expertise of the WC Support forum! They were able to give me potential causes & solutions. The highly specific, technical guidance I received from the forum helped resolve the issue. One of my main reasons for sticking with WooCommerce, despite being tempted by the sleek look of Shopify, is the wider availability of community support for WC. Thank you, WooCommerce community! Aggressive plugin update system eddio June 26, 2025 5 replies Purchased a plugin from Woo. Can not get automatic plugin updates UNLESS I connect my store to Woo. Had to manually download and then upload the plugin. Also, since they have merged up with WordPress, there is a mix up with saved login details, that is causing trouble when you are trying to achieve anything ‚Äì for example, connecting the site to Woo, finding your purchased plugins, new plugin releases etcOther then this, the WooCommerce plugin itself is great and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I really hope that they will update their system and remove this aggressive request to connect my site to Woo to unlock the plugin updates via admin dashboard. Once this is sorted, the review will be revisited.Thanks Waited a week plus for a response then they closed my ticket. mnjon June 25, 2025 1 reply Wow.
