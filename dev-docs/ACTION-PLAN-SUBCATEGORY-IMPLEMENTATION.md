# Action Plan: Subcategory Implementation for Wix Marketplace Scraper

## Phase 1: Analysis and Understanding

### 1.1 Analyze Current Implementation
- [ ] Locate the main Wix scraper file
- [ ] Find where categories are currently being extracted
- [ ] Identify the data structure used for storing app information
- [ ] Understand how the no-JS scraping approach works
- [ ] Document the current app data model structure

### 1.2 Study Category Implementation
- [ ] Find the category selector logic
- [ ] Understand how categories are parsed from HTML
- [ ] Review how categories are stored in the app object
- [ ] Check if there's any post-processing for categories

## Phase 2: Design and Planning

### 2.1 Design Subcategory Data Model
- [ ] Define subcategory object structure (id, displayName, parentCategory, url)
- [ ] Decide where to store subcategories in the app object
- [ ] Plan relationship mapping between categories and subcategories
- [ ] Document the new data model structure

### 2.2 Plan Selector Strategy
- [ ] Write the primary CSS selector for subcategories
- [ ] Write the fallback selector using URL patterns
- [ ] Plan how to differentiate between category and subcategory buttons
- [ ] Document edge cases for selector logic

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 3.1 Extend Data Structures
- [ ] Add subcategories array to app data model
- [ ] Create subcategory interface/type definition
- [ ] Update any TypeScript interfaces if applicable
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing data

### 3.2 Implement Subcategory Extraction Logic
- [ ] Create function to extract subcategory data from HTML element
- [ ] Implement logic to extract subcategory ID from data-hook
- [ ] Extract display name from button text
- [ ] Parse parent category from URL or context
- [ ] Extract full subcategory URL

### 3.3 Integrate with App Detail Scraping
- [ ] Locate where app details are scraped
- [ ] Add subcategory extraction after category extraction
- [ ] Use querySelector with data-hook selector
- [ ] Implement fallback selector if primary fails
- [ ] Handle case when no subcategories exist

### 3.4 Handle Parent-Child Relationships
- [ ] Parse parent category from subcategory URL
- [ ] Match subcategories to their parent categories
- [ ] Store relationship information appropriately
- [ ] Handle multiple parent categories if needed

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Test subcategory extraction with sample HTML
- [ ] Test edge case: no subcategories
- [ ] Test edge case: multiple subcategories
- [ ] Test edge case: subcategories under different parents
- [ ] Test selector fallback logic

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with QuickBooks app (accounting subcategory)
- [ ] Test with Google Ads app (ads subcategory)
- [ ] Test with apps having no subcategories
- [ ] Test with apps having multiple subcategories
- [ ] Verify data structure integrity

### 4.3 Internationalization Testing
- [ ] Test with Spanish Wix site (es.wix.com)
- [ ] Test with English Wix site (www.wix.com)
- [ ] Verify subcategory IDs remain consistent
- [ ] Confirm display names are properly localized

## Phase 5: Output and Documentation

### 5.1 Update Output Format
- [ ] Modify JSON output to include subcategories
- [ ] Ensure subcategories are properly nested/structured
- [ ] Update any CSV output if applicable
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

### 5.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Add try-catch for subcategory extraction
- [ ] Log warnings for extraction failures
- [ ] Ensure scraper continues if subcategory extraction fails
- [ ] Add debug logging for subcategory extraction

### 5.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with subcategory information
- [ ] Document subcategory data structure
- [ ] Add example output with subcategories
- [ ] Document any new command-line options

## Phase 6: Final Validation

### 6.1 Full Test Run
- [ ] Run scraper on sample set of apps
- [ ] Verify all subcategories are extracted correctly
- [ ] Check data consistency across different apps
- [ ] Validate output format is correct

### 6.2 Performance Check
- [ ] Ensure subcategory extraction doesn't slow down scraping
- [ ] Check memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] Verify no additional requests are needed

### 6.3 Code Review
- [ ] Review code for DRY principles
- [ ] Ensure KISS principle is followed
- [ ] Check for any unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Verify error handling is robust

- [ ] Internationalization works correctly
- [ ] Output format includes subcategories
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
