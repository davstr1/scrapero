# Wix Scraper Deduplication Implementation Summary

## Problem
The Wix Marketplace Scraper was producing duplicate rows because apps appear in multiple categories, and the scraper was adding the same app multiple times without proper deduplication.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core Deduplication Logic
- **Location**: `/src/scrapers/wix-app-market-nojs/index.js` (lines 44-95)
- **Method**: Using a Map to track unique apps by slug
- **Process**:
  - Sitemap apps are added first to the Map
  - Category-discovered apps are checked against the Map
  - If app exists, category data is merged
  - If new app, it's added to the Map

### 2. URL Discovery Deduplication
- **Location**: `/src/scrapers/wix-app-market-nojs/lib/url-discovery.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `uniqueAppsMap` to track apps during discovery
  - Modified app processing to merge duplicates immediately
  - Tracks additional categories and discovery sources

### 3. Data Structure Improvements
- **New CSV Fields**:
  - `additionalCategories`: Other categories where app appears
  - `allSubcategories`: Consolidated subcategories from all appearances
- **Location**: `/src/scrapers/wix-app-market-nojs/lib/app-scraper.js` (lines 206-207)

### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- **Duplicate Statistics**: Added to discovery summary showing:
  - Total apps before deduplication
  - Duplicates removed
  - Deduplication rate percentage
- **Pre-save Validation**: Warns if duplicates detected before saving

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Deduplication**: Apps tracked by unique slug
2. **Category Preservation**: All category associations maintained
3. **Zero Duplicates**: Final output contains exactly one entry per app
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear statistics on deduplication process

## Testing Results

- Quick scrape test: ✅ No duplicates found
- Single app test: ✅ Working correctly
- Deduplication is functional and properly merges category data

## Benefits

1. **Data Quality**: Clean, duplicate-free output
2. **Complete Information**: All category associations preserved
3. **Transparency**: Clear logging of deduplication process
4. **Performance**: Efficient Map-based deduplication

The implementation successfully eliminates all duplicate rows while preserving complete category information for each app.
