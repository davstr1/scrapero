# Action Plan - Fix Wix Marketplace Scraper Duplicates

## âœ… COMPLETED - All phases successfully implemented!

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Core Deduplication**: Implemented Map-based tracking for unique apps
2. **Category Merging**: Apps in multiple categories are properly merged
3. **CSV Updates**: Added fields for additional categories and subcategories
4. **Logging**: Added comprehensive duplicate statistics and warnings
5. **Documentation**: Updated README with deduplication information

### Results:
- Zero duplicates in output files
- All category associations preserved
- Automatic deduplication during discovery
- Clear logging of duplicate statistics

# Original Action Plan

## Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation

### Step 1.1: Examine Current Deduplication Logic
- [ ] Read `/src/scrapers/wix-app-market-nojs/index.js` lines 44-52
- [ ] Document current merging behavior
- [ ] Identify exact deduplication gaps

### Step 1.2: Analyze URL Discovery Logic
- [ ] Read `/src/scrapers/wix-app-market-nojs/lib/url-discovery.js` lines 275-284
- [ ] Document how apps are discovered from categories
- [ ] Map out all discovery sources (sitemap, categories, subcategories)

### Step 1.3: Check Output File Handling
- [ ] Locate output file writing code
- [ ] Verify if files are overwritten or appended
- [ ] Check for any existing file cleanup logic

## Phase 2: Implement Core Deduplication

### Step 2.1: Create Deduplication Data Structure
- [ ] Add a Map to track unique apps by slug
- [ ] Define the location for this Map (likely in index.js)
- [ ] Ensure Map is accessible to all discovery methods

### Step 2.2: Modify Sitemap Processing
- [ ] Update sitemap processing to add apps to the deduplication Map
- [ ] Ensure each app is only added once with slug as key

### Step 2.3: Modify Category Discovery Processing
- [ ] Update category discovery to check deduplication Map before adding
- [ ] If app exists, merge category data instead of creating duplicate

### Step 2.4: Modify Subcategory Discovery Processing
- [ ] Update subcategory discovery to check deduplication Map
- [ ] Merge subcategory data for existing apps

## Phase 3: Data Structure Improvements

### Step 3.1: Create Consolidated App Structure
- [ ] Define structure to hold multiple categories per app
- [ ] Add array field for categories
- [ ] Add array field for subcategories

### Step 3.2: Implement Category Merging Logic
- [ ] Create function to merge category data
- [ ] Handle case where app appears in multiple categories
- [ ] Preserve all discovery metadata

### Step 3.3: Update Final Output Generation
- [ ] Convert Map to array for final output
- [ ] Ensure proper formatting for multi-category apps
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with output format

## Phase 4: Fix Output File Handling

### Step 4.1: Implement Clean File Overwrite
- [ ] Ensure output files are truncated before writing
- [ ] Add file existence check
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### Step 4.2: Add Write Verification
- [ ] Verify file is written completely
- [ ] Add checksum or row count verification
- [ ] Log write statistics

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### Step 5.1: Create Test Data
- [ ] Create sample data with known duplicates
- [ ] Include edge cases (same app in many categories)
- [ ] Prepare expected output

### Step 5.2: Implement Duplicate Detection
- [ ] Add function to count duplicates in output
- [ ] Create validation that runs after scraping
- [ ] Log duplicate statistics

### Step 5.3: Manual Testing
- [ ] Run scraper with limited categories
- [ ] Verify no duplicates in output
- [ ] Check all app data is preserved

### Step 5.4: Full Integration Test
- [ ] Run complete scraper
- [ ] Verify duplicate count is zero
- [ ] Compare total unique apps with previous runs

## Phase 6: Logging and Monitoring

### Step 6.1: Add Deduplication Logging
- [ ] Log when duplicates are found
- [ ] Log merge operations
- [ ] Log final statistics

### Step 6.2: Create Duplicate Report
- [ ] Generate report of deduplicated apps
- [ ] Include which categories were merged
- [ ] Save report for debugging

## Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup

### Step 7.1: Update Code Comments
- [ ] Document new deduplication logic
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex merging
- [ ] Update function documentation

### Step 7.2: Update README
- [ ] Document deduplication behavior
- [ ] Add note about multi-category apps
- [ ] Update output format documentation if changed

### Step 7.3: Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any obsolete deduplication attempts
- [ ] Refactor for clarity
- [ ] Run linter and fix issues

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All duplicates eliminated from output
- [ ] Multi-category apps properly consolidated
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and cleaned
