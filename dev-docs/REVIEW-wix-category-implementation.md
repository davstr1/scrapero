# Wix App Market Category Implementation Review

## Summary
Successfully implemented category detection for Wix App Market scraper. Categories are now being automatically detected and included in the scraped data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Category Detection System
- Created `CategoryMapper` class with keyword-based detection
- Maps apps to 8 main categories:
  - Marketing
  - eCommerce  
  - Business Services
  - Communication
  - Design & Content
  - Site Management
  - Tools & Widgets
  - Developer Tools

### 2. Detection Algorithm
1. Checks app slug for keywords
2. Falls back to app name 
3. Falls back to description
4. Returns "Other" if no match found
