# Full Scrape Analysis for WordPress Commercial Plugins

## Scope
- **Total pages**: ~30 pages
- **Plugins per page**: 20
- **Total plugins**: ~600 commercial plugins
- **Requests needed**: ~630 (30 listing pages + 600 detail pages)

## Current Limits
1. **maxPages**: 10 (needs to be increased to 35)
2. **maxRequestsPerCrawl**: 500 (needs to be increased to 700+)
3. **Rate limiting**: 10 requests/minute with 6s delay
4. **Timeout**: 300 seconds per request
5. **Concurrency**: 2 simultaneous requests

## Time Estimate
With current rate limiting (6 seconds between requests):
- 630 requests Ã— 6 seconds = 3,780 seconds = **63 minutes minimum**
- With processing overhead: **~75-90 minutes**

## Recommendations for Full Scrape

### Option 1: Full Scrape (Recommended)
```json
{
  "maxPages": 35,
  "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 700,
  "maxConcurrency": 3,
  "rateLimit": {
    "requestsPerMinute": 15,
    "delayBetweenRequests": 4000
  }
}
```
- Time: ~45-60 minutes
- More aggressive but still respectful

### Option 2: Conservative Full Scrape
Keep current settings but increase:
```json
{
  "maxPages": 35,
  "maxRequestsPerCrawl": 700
}
```
- Time: ~75-90 minutes
- Very respectful to WordPress.org servers

### Option 3: Batch Processing
Run in 3 batches of 10 pages each:
- Batch 1: Pages 1-10
- Batch 2: Pages 11-20  
- Batch 3: Pages 21-30

## Potential Issues
1. **Memory usage**: May grow to 500MB+ with 600 plugins
2. **Timeout**: Total scrape time exceeds any reasonable timeout
3. **Rate limiting**: WordPress.org might have additional protections
4. **Network interruptions**: Long-running process vulnerable to failures

## Pre-flight Checklist

- [x] CSV output functioning
- [x] Extended descriptions captured
- [ ] Increase maxPages to 35
- [ ] Increase maxRequestsPerCrawl to 700
- [ ] Consider reducing rate limit delay
- [ ] Clear existing CSV before starting
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during run
